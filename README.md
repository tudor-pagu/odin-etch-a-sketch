This is a project I made as a part of following the Odin Project curriculum.

It is a grid of squares that color themselves to a random color when hovered over with a 
mouse. On subsequent hovers, the shade of color remains the same but grows darker.
You can reset the grid to any "resolution" (number of squares) you want.

While coding this, I learned about programatically adding nodes to the DOM and practiced using event listeners. I also learned more about rbg colors in css.
